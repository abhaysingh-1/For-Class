Java Server Pages (JSP)
===========================
> Its an API of J2EE which accepts the Request
  & generates "Dynamic Response"

> With Respect to functionality, both Servlets & 
  JSP are one & the same because JSP get "translated
  to a Servlet" at runtime

> JSP Separates "Business Logic" from "Presentation 
  Logic" however these two are tightly coupled in 
  case of Servlets
  
> With this separation different people can work on 
  different tasks
1. "Web Designer" can develop "Presentation Logic"
2. "Web Developer" can develop "Business Logic" 
    
Business Logic : 
-----------------------
Logic/Java Code to generate the Dynamic Data 
using JDBC / Hibernate / Design Patterns, etc.,

Presentation Logic : 
-----------------------
Logic to Present the Dynamic Data in Browser using 
HTML, CSS, Java Script, etc.,
             
> Whenever First Request comes to JSP, 	
  1. Translate the JSP into a Servlet (i.e. ".java" file)
  2. Compiles the Servlet (i.e. ".class" file)
  3. This ".class" file is used to Generate the Response
     
  All these things are done by Container & it happens 
  behind the scene at runtime

> Hence time taken to generate the response for First 
  Request is more compared to Subsequent Requests

> There are two ways to access JSP
  1. By using the JSP File Name directly in URL
  2. By configuring URL for a JSP in "web.xml" 
     & using this configured URL in Web URL

> Second Approch helps us to achieve "Security" 
  & "Maintainablity" 

> "javax.servlet.jsp.*" is the package representation
  of JSP API

> By default JSP handles ONLY HTTP / HTTPS Protocols
  i.e. by default JSP API is "Protocol Dependent"
  where as Servlet API is "Protocol Independent"
  
MyFirstJSP.jsp
==============

<%@page import="java.util.Date"%>

<html>
<body>
	<%
	  //Java Code to Generate Current Date & Time
	  Date dateRef = new Date();
	  String currDate = dateRef.toString();
    %>
	<h1>
		Current Date & Time is : 
		<font color="red"><%= currDate %></font>
	</h1>
</body>
</html>

Configuring URL for JSP in web.xml :-
======================================
<servlet>
	<servlet-name>myFirstJsp</servlet-name>
	<jsp-file>/MyFirstJSP.jsp</jsp-file>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>myFirstJsp</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>/currentDateJsp</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

URL's to Access JSP :
========================

1. Using JSP File Name
-----------------------
http://localhost:8080/studentsApp/MyFirstJSP.jsp


2. Using Configured URL
-----------------------
http://localhost:8080/studentsApp/currentDateJsp
