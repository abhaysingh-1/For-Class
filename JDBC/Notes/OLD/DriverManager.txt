java.sql.DriverManager 
==========================
> DriverManager is a "Concrete Class" present 
  in JDBC API & as the name implies, it manages 
  the drivers
  
> It helps us to establish the connection to DB 
  & for that it requires following two critical 
  informations
  1. Driver Class 
  2. DB URL 
  
> DriverManager consist of only one constructor 
  which is "Private Default" in nature 
  
> Hence it cannot be inherited or instantiated. 
  So whatever the methods it exposes to outside
  world, they "should be public static" in 
  nature
  
> DriverManagerâ€™s getConnection() method helps 
  us to establish the connection to the DB 

  - This method throws SQLException if it is 
    unable to establish the connection to the DB
	
  - OR this method returns an object of 
    "Connection" if it is able to establish the
	connection to the DB
  
> "java.sql.Connection" is an interface & an 
   Object of Connection is an "Object 
   representation of Physical DB Connection" 
   that is used by Java program to communicate 
   with DB
  
  
  
  
  
> DriverManager has 3 overloaded version of 
  getConnection() methods

1. Connection getConnection(String dbUrl) 
   throws SQLException

  String dbUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BECE67_DB
				  ?user=root&password=root";
				
  Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl);


2. Connection getConnection(String dbUrl, 
							String userNM, 
							String password) 
  throws SQLException

 String dbUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BECE67_DB";
 String userNM = "root";
 String pass = "root";
				
 Connection con 
			= DriverManager
				.getConnection(dbUrl, userNM, pass);


3.  Connection getConnection
					(String url, 
					 Properties info) 
throws SQLException
	 
String dbUrl = 
"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BECE67_DB";
		
String filePath = "D:\\db.properties";

FileReader reader 
			= new FileReader(filePath);
		
Properties props = new Properties();
props.load(reader);
		
Connection con 
 = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, props);

 
Data Present in "db.properties" File is:- 
=============================================	
#DB Credentials
user = root
password = root
