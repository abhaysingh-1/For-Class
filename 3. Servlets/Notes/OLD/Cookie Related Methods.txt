Cookies
========
> Cookies are little piece of information 
  in the form of name-value string pair 
  exchanged between browser & server
  
> Cookies are created by server and Maintained 
  by browser & hence Cookies are 
  "Browser Dependent"

> Cookies are the One & Only way in Servlet API, 
  If we want to store any information in
  "User Browser" 
  
> There are two types of cookies,
	1. Non-Persistent Cookie
	2. Persistent Cookie








1. Non-Persistent Cookie (it's default) :-
------------------------------------------
> Non-Persistent Cookie lives as long as
  Browser is kept open. Once the Browser
  is closed cookie disapears
  
2. Persistent Cookie :-
---------------------
> Persistent Cookie will be present in 
  Browser even after Browser is Closed

Cookie Related Methods :-
=========================

1. public Cookie(String name, String value)
 
> It's the ONE & ONLY constructor avilable in 
  "javax.servlet.http.Cookie" Concrete Class
  
> It creates the Cookie Object with specified 
  name & value
  
> Name can contain only "Alphanumeric 
  Character" but should not contain comma, 
  white space, semicolons and should not 
  begin with "$" 
  
> Cookie name "cannot be changed" after 
  creation

> Value can be anything & it "can be changed" 
  after creation
  
  
  
  
  










2. String Cookie.getName()
============================
> This method returns the Name of the Cookie



3. String Cookie.getValue()
==============================
> This method returns the Value of the Cookie
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. void HttpServletResponse.addCookie(Cookie cookieObj)
========================================================
> This method add the specified Cookie to the Response
> This method can be called Multiple times to set more
  than one Cookie to the Response
  
  
  
5. Cookie[] HttpServletRequest.getCookies()
=============================================
> This method returns 
  - an "Array containing all the Cookie Objects" 
  OR 
  - returns "NULL" if request does not have Cookies
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. void Cookie.setMaxAge(int expiry)
=====================================
> set's the max age of the Cookie in "Seconds" 
> +ve Value makes Cookie "Persistent" in nature
> -ve Value makes Cookie "Non-Persistent" in nature
> 0 Value makes Cookie to be "Deleted Immediately"
 
 
 
 
 
Examples :
=============
1. Create Cookie
------------------
//Non-Persistent Cookie
Cookie myNameCookie 
		= new Cookie("myName", "Praveen D");

//Persistent Cookie
Cookie myLocationCookie 
		= new Cookie("myLocation", "Bangalore");
//Time in Seconds		
myLocationCookie.setMaxAge(7*24*60*60);

//Send the above Cookies in the Response
resp.addCookie(myNameCookie);
resp.addCookie(myLocationCookie);

out.println("Cookies Created ...");

2. Read Cookie
------------------
//Get Cookies From Request
Cookie[] receivedCookies = req.getCookies();

if(receivedCookies == null) {
  out.println("Cookies are NOT present");
}else{
  out.println("Cookies are present");
	
  for(Cookie rcvdCookie : receivedCookies){
	//Print the Cookie Info (Name & Value) in Browser
	out.println("Cookie Name:"+rcvdCookie.getName());
	out.println("Cookie Value:"+rcvdCookie.getValue());
  }
}//End of if-else

3. Delete Cookie
------------------
//Get Cookies From Request
Cookie[] receivedCookies = req.getCookies();

if(receivedCookies == null){
  out.println("Cookies are NOT Present");
}else{
  out.println("Cookies are present");
   for(Cookie rcvdCookie : receivedCookies) {
	 String name = rcvdCookie.getName();
	 //Delete ONLY 'myLocation' Cookie
	 if(name.equals("myLocation"))
	 {
	   rcvdCookie.setMaxAge(0);
	   resp.addCookie(rcvdCookie);
	   out.println("Deleted 'myLocation' Cookie");
	   break;
	 }
	}//End of for
}//End of if-else
