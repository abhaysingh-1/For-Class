> Create Servelt by name "StudentSearchServlet", 
  which gets the request from this form,
1. Get the Form Data
2. Check this Reg. No. exists in BECM12_DB DataBase 
3. If No, Print the Error Message in the Browser
4. If Yes, Get the corresponding Reg. No. Data from 
   BECM12_DB DataBase 
   ( Combination of Data Present in 
     students_info & 
	 guardian_info Tables), 
  and display the Data in the Browser as shown below 
  
  	
	
	
SQL Query:-
-----------
select * from 
students_info si, guardian_info gi
where si.regno = gi.regno 
and si.regno = ?	









Note:-
======
> Since this form doesn't collects either 
  1. sensitive info or
  2. huge amount of info 
     "method" attribute of the form can have 
     - method="get" (preferred) or 
     - method="post"
  
> Create "StudentSearchServlet"	by extending 
  "HttpServlet" & Override doGet() Method

> In doGet() Method perform the below Operations
  1. Get the Form Data
  2. Search for Student Data by interacting with DB
     using JDBC
  3. Generate the Success / Error Response
  
> After creating the Servlet configure URL for that
  servlet in web.xml (/search)
  
> URL to Access:
==================
HTML :- 
------------
http://localhost:8080/studentsApp/Search.html

Servlet:- 
------------
http://localhost:8080/studentsApp/studentSearch

> Provide Servlet URL in <form> tag "action" attribute
action=
    "http://localhost:8080/studentsApp/studentSearch"

> Since this Servelt needs to interact with DB, it 
  MUST make use of JDBC & JDBC requires Driver JAR file
  
> Copy & Paste Driver JAR file into 
  “WebContent/WEB-INF/lib” folder
  
> First access the HTML form using HTML URL, fillout 
  the form & submit the form to make request to Servlet
