***************************
*    Java Thumb Rules     *
***************************
> Anything in Java,
- which start with Upper-case Letter & without parenthesis  
  is either "Class Name OR Interface Name"  
  
- which start with Lower-case Letter & without parenthesis 
  is a "Variable Name"

- which start with Lower-case Letter & with parenthesis 
  is a "Method Name"

- which start with Upper-case Letter & with parenthesis 
  is a "Constructor"
	
> In Java, anything apart from Primitive Data Types 
  are called as "Object References"  
  
  For Ex:
  ---------
  int i;
  boolean isTrue;
  Abc ref;
   
  Where,  
  - "i" &  "isTrue" are Primitive Data Types
  - "ref" is a Object Reference Variable
	where "Abc" can be 
	an Interface OR
	an Abstract Class OR
	Concrete Class  
  
> A Class which is declared 
   - with "abstract" keyword is called as an 
     "Abstract Class"

   - "without abstract" keyword is called as 
     "Concrete Class"
  
> Hence all "final classes" are "Concrete Class"
  

  
  
  
  

  Java Class
   |
   |---> Abstract Class
   |
   |---> Concrete Class
			|
			|---> Final Class
			|
			|---> Non-Final Class
			
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
> Simply having an Interface (which has more than 
  one abstract methods) in Java is of "No Use" & 
  there MUST be a "At-least One Implementation Class"  
  
> Simply having an Abstract Class (which has min. 
  one non-static methods) is of "No Use" & 
  there MUST be a "At-least One Sub-Class"  
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
> In Java, "Super Class" can be 
   - either an "Abstract Class" or 
   - "Concrete Class"





  
  
  
  
  

  



	
	
	

	
> If a method/constructor input argument is other 
  than primitive data type 
  
  AND/OR
  
  If a method return type is other than primitive 
  data type,
  
  then it can be 
  "Interface / Concrete Class / Abstract Class"

  For Ex:
  -------
  public Xyz myMethod(Abc ref) {
	//Some Business Logic
  }

  Where  
  - "ref" is a Object Reference Variable
  - "Abc & Xyz" can be 
	an Interface OR
	an Abstract Class OR
	Concrete Class

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
13. There are two types of Interfaces
    1. Marker Interface
    2. Non-Marker Interface
  
14. If a Class implements an interface & we are 
    getting the compilation error means it must be 
	a Non-Marker Interface & this interface SHOULD 
	have One/More Abstract Methods
  
15. If a Class implements an interface & we are NOT 
    getting any compilation error means it can be a 
    Non-Marker / Marker Interface.
  
16. If it is a Non-Marker interface then it SHOULD 
    NOT consist of ANY Abstract Methods but it will 
	consist of only Variables
  
Method Overloading
===================
> If Methods names are "Same"   
  + if it has 
    ( different number OR different types )
	of arguments
  then its called as "Method Overloading"	

> Overloading can happen in 
  "Same Class" as well as "Sub Class"
  
Method Overriding
===================  
> It happens ONLY in Sub Class
> Hence Sub-Class should have same method signature 
  as Super-Class however,
  - We can increase the Visibility of the methods 
  - return type SHOULD be same for Primitive Data-Types
  - return type can be of "covariant type" for 
    Non Primitive Data-Types
  - Method name should be same
  - Method input arguments should be same.
    If not, then it becomes "Method Overloading"
  - We can decrease the visibility of the Exceptions
