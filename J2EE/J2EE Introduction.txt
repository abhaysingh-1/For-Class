J2EE Introduction
===================

Computer
=========
> It is a combination of hardware + an Operating 
  System
  
> Computers are represented as shown below




Application 
==============
> Every Application has its own dedicated 
  functionality. For ex: 
  - Adobe Reader can only open pdf files
  - Media Player can only open media files

> Every Application has its own known file 
  extensions. For ex: 
  - Adobe Reader can only understand ".pdf" files
  - Media Player can only understand ".mp3" or
    ".avi" files
	   
> Every Application in this world is "Platform 
  Dependent" including Java Application

> Java as an "Application" is "Platform Dependent" 
  however Java as a "Programming Language" is 
  "Platform Independent"
	
> Java Programming Language is Platform 
  Independent because "JRE / JVM" Platform 
  Dependent
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
> "Applications acts like an interface between 
  "User" and an "Operating System"

Operating System
=================
> It acts like an interface between an 
  "Application" and "underlying Hardware"

  
  
  
  
  
  
Types of Applications 
=======================
> There are 2 types of Applications
  1. Desktop / Standalone application(unshared)
  2. Web Applications (Shared)
	
> Desktop Applications are present in our own 
  computer & they are dedicated per user
ex: Adobe Reader, Web Browser, Media Player, etc..
	
> Web applications are not present in our own 
  computer but they are present in some other 
  computer where our own computer and that 
  computer is "Network Connected"
  ex: Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, etc.,

> To interact with web applications we must 
  make use of
  1. Network
  2. Web Browser

> Web Browser is a Desktop Application & if we 
  are using Browser means we are interacting 
  with Web Applications
  
> A network is a collection of computers and 
  there are two types of Network:
  1. Intranet(Private Network)
  2. Internet(Public Network)
	
> Hence Web Applications can be present either 
  in "Intranet" or in "Internet"
  ex: 
  - Gmail Web Application is present in Internet
  - "Jspider Attendance Tracking Web Application"
    is present in Intranet		
	
> I.P Address / "Computer Name (DNS Name)" 
  Uniquely identifies a perticular Computer 
  in a Network




  
Server
===========
> Server is also a computer, but the hardware 
  configuration of this computer will be pretty 
  high level when compared to a Desktop Computer
  ex: Server can have 22TB of RAM

> Servers are represented as shown below
  
  
  
  
  
  
Relational DataBase Management System / 
RDBMS Application / DataBase / DB
=================================================
> It's also an application which helps us to   
  store and maintain Giga-Bytes to Tera-Bytes of data 

> RDBMS Application is represented as shown below









Java 2 Enterprise Edition / J2EE / JEE / Java EE
=================================================
> J2EE is a collection of API's (Application 
  Programming Interface), which helps us to 
  develop "Enterprise Web Applications"

> An API is a "Collection of Packages" with a 
  dedicated "functionality"

> Major API's of J2EE are
  1. JDBC 
  2. Servlet
  3. JSP

> JDBC API helps Web Application to interact   
  with RDBMS Application

> Servlet and JSP API's helps web application to 
  - get the request from browser, 
  - generate the response and 
  - gives it back to the browser

> J2EE helps to develop "Web Applications" 
  where as "Andriod / iOS" helps to develop "Mobile Apps" 

> "Mobile Apps" are 2-Tier Architectured 
  Applications

> However "Web Applications" acts like 
  - 3-Tier architecture application if it is 
    accessed using "Web Browser"
  - 2-Tier architecture application if it is 
    accessed using "Mobile Apps"

> 3-Tier architectured applications are easy to
  "maintain" as compared to 2-Tier architectured 
  applications
